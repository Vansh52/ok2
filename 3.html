, Humans are the main cause of water pollution, which is triggered in many ways: by the dumping of industrial waste; due to temperature rise, that cause the alteration of water by reducing the oxygen in its composition; Or due to deforestation, which causes sediments and bacteria to appear under the soil and therefore contaminate groundwater.

In the same way, the pesticides used in agricultural fields filter through underground channels and reach the consumption networks; And also as a result of accidental spillage of oil.
